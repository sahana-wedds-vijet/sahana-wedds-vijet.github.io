					<h2>Sahana</h2>
					<p>
					Sarah is most thankful to her parents for the gift of two loving big brothers & five amazing role-model sisters. As the second-youngest, Sarah spent her childhood twirling & dancing around, putting on talent shows for her parents & grandparents. Her creative spirit and eye for design was established at a young age, as she highly disapproved of Mattel’s © furnishings and décor within her Barbie House. If Barbie needed an interior makeover (which was frequent) Sarah looked through home furnishing catalogs for inspiration, drew the new contents by hand and placed them as backdrops in the Barbie house. After graduation from Mater Dei High School, Sarah explored the metropolitan life in San Francisco and graduated with a BS in Interior Design from San Francisco State University. Sarah is adding to her vows that she will forever allow a one-room “man-den” with it’s contents and décor subject to Bradley’s discretion.
